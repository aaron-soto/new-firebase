        The journey of web development technologies began with simple HTML pages
        in the early days of the internet. Over time, advancements led to the
        incorporation of CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. This
        evolution transformed static websites into dynamic and responsive
        platforms, setting the stage for the complex and feature-rich web
        applications we have today.

        Web development in future will be driven by advances in Â browser

        The web development life cycle is a method that outlines the stages
        involved in building websites and web applications. It provides a
        structured approach, ensuring optimal results throughout the development
        process.

        Debra Howcraft and John Carroll proposed a methodology in which web
        development process can be divided into sequential steps. They mentioned
        different aspects of analysis.

        Phase one involves crafting a web strategy and analyzing how a website
        can effectively achieve its goals. Keil et al&apos;s research identifies
        the primary reasons for software project failures as a lack of top
        management commitment and misunderstandings of system requirements. To
        mitigate these risks, Phase One establishes strategic goals and
        objectives, designing a system to fulfill them. The decision to
        establish a web presence should ideally align with the
        organization&apos;s corporate information strategy.
